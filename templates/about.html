        <p>
            I’m a trained Red School menstruality mentor, having completed the Menstruality Leadership Programme in 2022 
            and Menopause the Great Awakener trainings in 2023 and 2024.  
        </p>

        <p>
            I am an active voluntary contributor to their graduate online community. 
            I’ve organised an in-person regional meet-up for graduates and participate in regular trainings and facilitation CPD.
