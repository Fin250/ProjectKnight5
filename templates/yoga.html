            <p>Yoga as a method to manage menopause <br><br>Following a 30-hour Menoyoga™ training, as an add-on to my existing long-term yoga practice, I can offer solar and lunar sequences specifically designed to balance the nervous system and develop strength.</p>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/Yoga_badge.png') }}" alt="Yoga badge" class="yoga-badge">
            <p>As cyclical beings, our bodies need different types of nourishment and movement at different stages of our cycle, and across the arc of the menopause transition. These sessions provide adapted postural guidance in-line with the Menoyoga™ trainings and work in-line with the body's changes in collagen, nervous system challenges and muscle strength. They offer a combination of cooling yin asanas and balance of yang yoga practices. This will help ease overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system which can lead to too much heat in the body which can present itself as irritablity, poor concentration, anger, frustration and physical inflammation.</p>
